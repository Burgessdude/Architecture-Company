Hey everyone my name is Jake.I'm majoring in Web Design and Development with an Interaction and Design emphasis. I'm a junior right now, I'm taking 17 credits this semester. I work at a dental lab right now as long as going to school. I'm just looking forward to learning some more about programming over the semester and learn some more front end stuff. It should be fun.
